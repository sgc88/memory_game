	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	<p>The card game memory, aka concentration, is a childrenâ€™s game that tests visual recall ability.</p>
	<p>There are n pairs of cards face down. The first player flips over 2 cards to make a pair. If a match is made, the player keeps the cards, gets 1 point, and goes again. If not, the player flips the cards over and the next player goes, playing by the same rules. The game ends when all pairs are made and the person with the most points wins. (In this version, the goal is to maximize the point total).</p>
